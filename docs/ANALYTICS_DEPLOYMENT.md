# Analytics And Bug Report Deployment

Daily ships a first-party, aggregate-only analytics receiver. It is optional;
without `DAILY_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT`, the app sends no analytics network request.

## Ubuntu Receiver

The Ubuntu receiver uses only the Python standard library. Copy
`tool/analytics_receiver.py` to the host and run:

```bash
DAILY_ANALYTICS_BIND=127.0.0.1 \
DAILY_ANALYTICS_PORT=8787 \
DAILY_ANALYTICS_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/daily-analytics \
python3 tool/analytics_receiver.py
```

For a per-user systemd deployment, install `deploy/daily-analytics.service`
under `~/.config/systemd/user/`, enable it with `systemctl --user enable --now
daily-analytics`, and enable lingering for that service account so the receiver
starts after a reboot without an interactive login.

Run it under a dedicated unprivileged system user. Put an HTTPS reverse proxy
in front of `127.0.0.1:8787`, disable request-body and access logging for the
ingestion path, and expose only:

- `POST /v1/events`
- `POST /v1/bug-reports`
- `GET /health`

The receiver limits a request to 64 KiB and 25 events, applies an in-memory
per-address rate limit, revalidates the allowlist, and never logs request
bodies. Daily aggregates are stored in `analytics-YYYY-MM-DD.json`; delivery
dedupe hashes are stored separately. Aggregate files expire after 90 days and
dedupe files after seven days.

## Authenticated Bug Reports

The bug-report endpoint is separate from anonymous analytics. It runs only when
the user explicitly submits the in-app form and is available only while Daily
has an active Google session.

The app sends its Google bearer token to `/v1/bug-reports`. The receiver uses it
once with Google's OpenID Connect UserInfo endpoint, requires a verified email,
and never writes the bearer token to disk or logs. It then creates an issue in
`littlebit0/DailyCalendar` using a server-side GitHub credential owned by the
`littlebit0` account. The public issue contains the report and app environment,
but not the user's email address.

Create a fine-grained GitHub personal access token with access only to the
`littlebit0/DailyCalendar` repository and `Issues: Read and write`. Store it
outside the repository:

```bash
install -d -m 700 "$HOME/.config/daily"
read -rsp "GitHub token: " DAILY_GITHUB_TOKEN; echo
umask 077
printf 'DAILY_GITHUB_TOKEN=%s\n' "$DAILY_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  > "$HOME/.config/daily/bug-report.env"
unset DAILY_GITHUB_TOKEN
systemctl --user restart daily-analytics.service
```

The service loads this file through `EnvironmentFile` and never places the
credential in source control. Verified contact mappings are stored under
`/mnt/storage/daily-analytics/bug-report-contacts` with directory mode `0700`
and file mode `0600`; they expire after 365 days. Each Google identity is limited
to five accepted reports per hour.

## App Build

Use the public HTTPS ingestion URL only in a release build:

```bash
./tool/flutter.sh build ipa --release \
  --dart-define=DAILY_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT=https://analytics.example.com/v1/events \
  --dart-define=DAILY_BUG_REPORT_ENDPOINT=https://analytics.example.com/v1/bug-reports
```

Use the same `--dart-define` for the macOS build. A missing endpoint is a valid
privacy-safe configuration: consent can still be disabled or cleared, and no
network transmission occurs.

## Current Production Receiver

- Public endpoint: `https://littlebit.tail6514a4.ts.net/v1/events`
- Bug-report endpoint: `https://littlebit.tail6514a4.ts.net/v1/bug-reports`
- Health endpoint: `https://littlebit.tail6514a4.ts.net/health`
- Ubuntu service: `daily-analytics.service` (user systemd service)
- Receiver source: `~/.local/lib/daily-analytics/analytics_receiver.py`
- Aggregate storage: `/mnt/storage/daily-analytics` (HDD)
- Public HTTPS: Tailscale Funnel to `127.0.0.1:8787`

The `3.2.1` iOS and macOS App Store artifacts in
`dist/transporter-upload/3.2.1` include this endpoint. Collection remains off
until the user explicitly enables anonymous usage analytics in Daily.

## Verification

1. Leave `익명 사용성 분석 허용` off and verify that no ingestion request is
   received.
2. Turn it on and use calendar views, event editing, search, filters, and manual
   sync.
3. Verify the receiver aggregate contains only allowlisted enums and numeric
   measurements.
4. Confirm that no aggregate or dedupe file contains a session ID, event ID,
   account, calendar content, search text, token, or network address.
5. Disconnect the receiver, create events, and verify calendar and Drive sync
   still succeed while the bounded analytics queue waits independently.
6. Turn analytics off or use `분석 데이터 삭제` and verify the local queue is
   removed.
7. With a Google-signed-in test account, submit a bug report and verify that the
   GitHub issue contains the report but not the email address.
8. Confirm the matching private contact file is mode `0600`, contains the issue
   number and verified email, and never contains the bearer token.

Automated coverage for these boundaries is in:
